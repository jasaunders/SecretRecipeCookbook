This repository will contain the Secret Recipe application for Enterprise Java Class. 

### Problem Statement

I have been collecting recipes for over 20 years and as my collection grows, the organization becomes more and more difficult.
Also, I have nearly started the file folder on fire... twice!

I would like an application that lets me build and maintain recipes and keeps them secure and organized.
They could be shared on the internet or kept private.

As an added feature, I would like other users to be able to log in and create their own recipe books.
They could also choose to share their recipes or keep them private.
